            <div class="panel-body">
              <p class=question style="font-weight:bold;">1. What are the factors that affect climate of Australia?
                <div class=answer>
                  <p>Factors that affect climate of Australia are Location, Distance from the Oceans, winds and direction of mountain ranges.</br>
                    <ol>
                      <li><b>Location</b>: Australia is located in the <span class=keyword>Southern Hemisphere</span>, and seasons are opposite of seasons in India. It is Summer in December and winter in July. Upper part of Australia which is above <span class=keyword>Tropic of Capricorn</span>, lies in the tropical zone and has high temperature through out the year. Lower part of Australia, which is below Tropic of Capricorn, is in the temperate zone which has hot summer and cool winter.
                      <li><b>Distance from the Oceans</b>: Australia is surrounded by seas all sides. Nearness of the ocean affects the climate. The coastal areas are cooler and wetter than the inland areas. Central parts of the continent experience extreme climate. They have high temperature in summer and low temperature in winter.
                      <li><b>Winds</b>: Winds that blow from the sea often bring rain to the coast. They cause dry weather to the inland areas. Dry wind blowing in interior parts of continent and deserts have formed.
                      <li><b>Direction of Mountain Ranges</b>: The <span class=keyword>Great Dividing Range</span> runs parallel to the eastern coast. It acts as barrier to the winds blowing from south-east. Due to this, south-east has lot of rain. Due to this there is less rain in Western Plateau region. It is the rain shadow area of GDR.

                      <div class=answer>
                    <p>Ans. Four characteristic features of temperate grasslands are:</br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Known as "Downs" in Australia, much of the temperate grasslands lie in the Murray-Darling Basin.
                      <li>Summers are hot while the winters are cold.
                      <li>The region receives average rainfall.
                      <li>The temperate grasslands consist of short grass. Towards the west where the rainfall begins to decrease, the grasslands get replaced by scrub and bushes.
                    </ul></div>
                    <p class=question>Q. What type of climate prevails in the Western Plateau? Give two characteristic features of this type of climate.
                      <div class=answer>
                    <p>The tropical desert covers a major portion of the Western Plateau and hence this region has a tropical desert type of climate. Two main characteristics of this type of climate are:</br>
                    <p>Summers and extremely hot and winters extremely cold. There is also wide difference between the daily ranges of temperature.</br>
                      This region receives less than 25 cm of rainfall annually.</br>
                      </div>
                      <p class=question>Q. In what ways do the following factors affect the climate of Australia?
                      <ul><li>Latitude
                        <li>Direction of mountain ranges</ul></p>
                      <div class=answer>
                    <p>Ans. Latitude: The Tropic of Capricorn passes through the nearly the centre of Australia and hence the country falls under the influence of the trade winds.</br>
                    <p>Direction of mountain ranges: When moisture bearing trade winds strike the Eastern Highlands (running along the eastern coast), it rains on the eastern coast which lies on the windward side of the Eastern Highlands while the leeward side hardly receives any rainfall.</br>
                      </div>
                    <p class=question>Q. What is the most important river system of Australia? Name any four features of this river system.
                    <p class=answer>The most important river system of Australia is the Murray- Darling Basin.</br>
                      Four features of this river system are:</br>
                      The Murray is the main river of Australia while Darling is its tributary.</br>
                      This river system lies to the east of the Central Lowlands.</br>
                      Since the river Murray originates in the Australian Alps, it is a snow fed river and thus has sufficient water.</br>
                      The river Darling does not have much water and becomes dry during droughts. During excessive rains, it tends to change its course.</br></p>
                    <p class=question>Q. Write a short note on the availability of water in Australia.
                    <p class=answer>Australia is an island continent with limited water resources. Rainfall in the region is uneven, unreliable and low. Only about one eighth of the total rainwater flows on the surface while the rest is evaporated as most parts of Australia are desert like.</br>
                      The Murray-Darling river basin is the largest river basin in Australia. More than half of the water of this basin is used for irrigation and power generation.</br>
                      Australia has large quantities of underground water resources. It gets much of the underground water from the artesian basin.</br></p>

          <p class=question>1. What are the three main physical features of Australia?</p>
          <div class=answer>
          <p>Ans.
            Australia is the flattest continent in the world.
            The continent may be divided into three main physical features.</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>The Western Plateau
            <li>The Central Lowlands
            <li>The Eastern Highlands
          </ol>

          <p><b>The Western Plateau</b><br>
            The Western Plateau covers about two thirds of the continent and has an average elevation of 360 m above sea level. The plateau has smooth surface with gentle slopes and consists of very old rocks.</p>

          <p><b>The Central Lowlands</b></br>
            The Central Lowlands extend from the <b class=keyword>Gulf of Carpentaria</b> in the north to the southern coast of the continent. The central Lowlands consists of <b>three sections</b>. The <b>northern area</b> is drained by small rivers north wards into the gulf of Carpentaria. The <b>middle section</b> is a large basin of inland drainage with lake Eyre in the center. The <b>southern section</b> is drained by the <b class=keyword>Murray - Darling river</b> system.</p>

          <p><b>The Eastern Highlands</b></br>
            The Eastern Highlands extend parallel to the east coast from <b class=keyword>Cape York peninsula</b> in the north to Tasmania in the south. These highlands are also known as the <b class=keyword>Great Dividing Range</b>, though they are not barriers for movement.The highlands have lower altitude and gentler slopes in the north than in the south.</br>

            A peculiar feature of Australia is the <b class=keyword>Great Barrier Reef</b> which lies off the north-east coast. It lies at a distance of <b class=keyword>30 to 205 km</b> from the coast. The reef is formed by the skeletal remains of small marine organisms called <i>coral polyps</i>.It is called as the Great Barrier Reef because it acts as a barrier for movement of ships towards the coast. </p>

          <p class=question>2. Details about climate, rainfall, vegetation and wildlife of Australia</p>
          <div id=answer>
            The seasons of Australia are reversed compared to what we experience  in India because it lies in the Southern Hemisphere. The summer season is from December to February and winter season is from June to August.

            Climate of Australia
            The northern part of Australia lies in tropical Zone here the summer months are hot and the winter months are warm. The southern part of Australia lies in the Temperate zone, which is cooler. There is a great difference in temperature between summer and winter in this region compare to the tropical zone.

            Rainfall
            About half of the continent receives a low rainfall. A large area in the center gets extremely low rainfall of less than 25 cm. Australia is the world's driest inhabited continent. Hot deserts cover a large area of the continent.

            Tropical coastal region in the north gets rainfall more than 100 cm due to monsoon winds.During summer they blow from the north-west and in winter from south-east.Winter is the dry season.

            Rainfall is more along the coast and eastern high lands and decreases towards the interior.The east coast of Australia gets rainfall through out the year because the south east trade winds blow from the Pacific Ocean.
