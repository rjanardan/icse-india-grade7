        <h3>Unit 28: The Song of the Brook</h3>
        <div>
          <p class=question>
            Answer the following questions in your own words

          <p class=question>1. Who is the speaker in the poem?
          <p class=answer> Speaker of the poem is brook. It is telling about its journey from origin to merging into river. Its journey is long, thrilling and with obstacles. The brook's journey is very exciting.

          <p class=question>2. From where has the speaker come?
          <p class=answer>The brook's journey starts from top of a valley where birds like coot and hern visit often. He comes with loud noise and full force.

          <p class=question>3. What does the speaker cross on its way?
          <p class=answer>The brook crosses villages, bridges, farms, lawns, grassy plots and finally joins the brimming river. On the way, it finds flora and fauna, including willow-weed, mallow, trout, forget-me-nots and cresses.

          <p class=question>4. What does the speaker mean by ‘For men may come and men may go, but I go on for ever.’
          <p class=answer>The brook is immortal (never dies). Brook water merges into river. The river water converts into clouds. When it rains on the hills, brook again comes to life. Where as men die after some time.</p>
          <p class=question>Homework Q&A</p>
          <p>
            I murmur under the moon and stars
            In <a href="#" title="thorny">brambly</a> wildernesses;</br>
            I linger by my shiningly bars;</br>
            I loiter round my cresses;</br>
            And out again I curve and flow</br>
            To join the brimming river,</br>
            For men may come and men may go,</br>
            But I go on for ever.</br>
          </p>
          <p class=question>1. What kind of movement is depicted in the above lines.</p>
          <p class=answer>Ans: Here the brook is mentioning about its journey before merging into the river. The brook makes murmuring sounds in the night. It slows down and lazily passes the thorny uncultivated land and twists around the plants.
          <p class=question>2. What does the brook join?</p>
          <p class=answer>Ans: The brook originates at the top of a valley, falls down the steep slopes, crosses many bridges and fields. It finally merges into the river, where it ends its journey.</p>

          <p class=question>3. Do you think brook's life ends after it joins the river? Why?</p>
          <p class=answer>Ans: No, the brook's life does not end after joning the river. Brook transforms into river. The river water again converts into clouds in the sky. When it rains on the hills, brook again comes back to life. That is the reason author keeps repeating that "men may not exists, but brook goes on forever".</p>

          <h3>Unit 6: Home on the Veld</h3> 
          <div>
            <pre>
My mother was in charge of three rondavels at 
Qunu which, as I remember, were always filled
with the children of my relations. In fact, I 
can hardly remember any occasion as a child 
when I was alone. In African culture, the sons 
and daughters of one's aunts and uncles are
considered brothers and sisters, not cousins.
My mother's sister is my mother and my brother's
child is my son or my daughter.
            </pre>

            <p class=question>1. What was the author's mother
              responsible for?

              grew up, families used to stay together, eat together
              and played together. There were so many children of
              his uncle and aunts, that he never was alone.

            <p class=question>3. Describe family relationships
              in African culture.

              as joint family. Children of brothers and sisters
              were together. The sons and daughters of one's
              uncles and aunts are considered brothers and sisters,
              not cousins. Also, uncle and aunt are called father
              and mother.

            <p class=question>4. Compare relationships in the
              African culture with that of what you share within
              your own family.
            <p class=answer>A. Compared to how Nelson Mandela
              grew up, it is different in my family. Me and my
              cousin stay in different houses, but near by. We
              meet occasionally and have fun going to restaurants
              together. We meet on birthdays and greet each other.
              
            <pre>
It was in the fields that I learned  how to knock brids out of the sky
with  slingshot, to  gather wind  honey, fruits  and edible  roots, to
drink warm, sweet  milk straight from the  udder of a cow,  to swim in
the clear, cold  streams, and to catch fish with  string and sharpened
bits  of wire.  I learned  to  stick fight  - essential  to any  rural
African boy - and became skilled in its various techniques.
            </pre>

            <p class=question>1. What did the author learn in
              his childhood?

              of a cow. He also learnt how to catch fish and
              knock birds using slingshot.

            <p class=question>2. What was considered as the
              essential skill for African boys?
              
            <p class=answer>A. Nelson Mandela learnt various
              things like Of the many things Nelson Mandela
              learnt during early childhood. One thing that was
              essential knowledge was stick-fight. He became
              skilled in various techniques.

            <p class=question>3. Do you think the author had
              a happy childhood in spite of poverty? Give
              reasons for your answer.

              spaces to play. He had fun learning gathering of
              honey, catch fish and knock birds.

          <h3>Unit 8: Don Quixote Fights Some Giants</h3>
          <div>
            <p class=question>1. Whom did Don Quixote choose as his
              squire? How did he persuade him to become his squire?
            <p class=answer>A. Don Quixote chose Sancho Panza as
              his squire. Sancho Panza was a poor man. Don persuaded
              Sancho by promising many adventures. He also promised to
              make him governor of the islands they will conquer together.

            <p class="question">2. What arrangements did Don Quixote
              and his squire make for their adventures?
            <p class="answer">A. Sancho has brought his donkey with
              him as he did not own a horse. Sancho brought
              leather-bottle with full of water and empty saddlebags
              to receive the things they would win in their contests.

            <p class="question">3. Whom did Don Quixote mistake
              for giants? How did Sancho Panza try to correct his master?
              
            <p class="answer">A. Don mistook windmills for giants.
              He said some of the giants had arms more than six miles
              long. Sancho tried to correct his master. They are not
              giants but windmills. Arms are actually sails. But
              still Don thought they were giants.

            <p class="question">4. What was the result of Don Quixote's
                fight with the 'giants'?
            <p class="answer">A. Don attacked the nearest windmill,
                pushing his spear in to the sail. The sail rotated fast
                and broke the spear into many pieces. It threw Don
                and Rozinante down.

              <p class="question">5. How did he react to his defeat?
              <p class="answer">A. Don said that in war one's fortune
                can change easily. He said some magician had turned
                giants into windmills so that he would not be able
                to conquer them. But still Don had hope to win.

        <h3>Unit 16: Robin Hood and Alan a Dale</h3>
        <h5>Page: 91</h5>
        <p>Story summary:</p>
        <p>
          Robin Hood  one day  sees a cheerful  young man  dressed in      red,   singing   and  playing   in   the   greenwood:  it is  Alan-a-Dale. The  next day,  he sees  him again, dejected (sad,  worried). He sends two of his Merry Men,  "Little John" and "Much the Miller's Son",  to apprehend (arrest) him.</p>
        <p>
          Robin  asks  Alan for  money; but  he explains that  he has but  little, and  that the cause  of his sorrow is  that his truelove  is to  be married to  an elderly knight. When  Alan agrees to  serve Robin, the  latter springs into  action. He  turns  up at  the church  as  a harper,  but refuses  to play:  firstly, until  he has  seen the  bride and groom; secondly, after  he has seen them, because  he does not consider the old  man and the young girl a  suitable match.
        </p>
        <p>He blows  his  horn:  and  his Merry  Men,  now  including  Alan, appear. The bishop refuses to marry Alan and the girl, because it is  the law that consent  must be asked three  times. Robin puts the bishop's cloak on Little John, who mockingly asks the question seven times and then  marries the young couple, Robin giving away  the bride  in loco parentis (in place of parent).  All then - except, presumably, for the old knight and  the bishop - repair to the greenwood.

        <pre>

	 Come listen to me, you gallants so free,
	 All you that loves mirth for to hear,
	 And I will you tell of a bold outlaw,
	 That lived in Nottinghamshire.
	 That lived in Nottinghamshire.

	 As Robin Hood in the forest stood,
	 All under the green-wood tree,
	 There was he ware of a brave young man,
	 As fine as fine might be.

	 The youngster was clothed in scarlet red,
	 In scarlet fine and gay,
	 And he did frisk it over the plain,
	 And chanted a roundelay.

	 As Robin Hood next morning stood,
	 Amongst the leaves so gay,
	 There did he espy the same young man
	 Come drooping along the way.

	 The scarlet he wore the day before,
	 It was clean cast away;
	 And every step he fetched a sigh,
	 "Alack and a well-a-day!"

	 Then stepped forth brave Little John,
	 And <u>Much the miller's son,</u>
	 Which made the young man bend his bow,
	 When as he see them come.

     "Stand off, stand off!" the young man said,
	 "What is your will with me?"
	 "You must come before our master straight,
	 Under yon green-wood tree."

     And when he came bold Robin before,
	 Robin asked him courteously,
	 "O hast thou any money to spare
	 For my merry men and me?"

	 "I have no money," the young man said,
	 "But five shillings and a ring;
	 And that I have kept this seven long years,
	 To have it at my wedding."

     "Yesterday I should have married a maid,
	 But she is now from me ta'en,
	 And chosen to be an old knights delight,
	 Whereby my poor heart is slain."

     "What is thy name?" then said Robin Hood,
	 Come tell me, without any fail"
	 "By the faith of my body," then said the young man,
	 "My name it is Alan a Dale."

     "What wilt thou give me," said Robin Hood,
	 "In ready gold or fee,
	 To help thee to thy true-love again,
	 And deliver her unto thee?"

     "I have no money, then quoth the young man,
	 No ready gold nor fee,
	 But I will swear upon a book
	 Thy true servant for to be.

     How many miles is it to thy true-love?
	 Come tell me without any guile:
	 "By the faith of my body," then said the young man,
	 It is but five little mile."

	 Then Robin he hasted over the plain,
	 He did neither stint nor lin,
	 Vntil he came unto the church
	 Where Allin should keep his wedding.

     What dost thou do here? the bishop he said,
	 I prethee now tell to me:
	 I am a bold harper, quoth Robin Hood,
	 And the best in the north countrey.

	 "welcome, O welcome," the bishop he said,
	 That musick best pleaseth me;
	 You shall have no musick, quoth Robin Hood,
	 Till the bride and the bridegroom I see.

	 With that came in a wealthy knight,
	 Which was both grave and old,
	 And after him a finikin lass,
	 Did shine like glistering gold.

	 This is no fit match, quoth bold Robin Hood,
	 That you do seem to make here;
	 For since we are come unto the church,
	 The bride she shall chuse her own dear.

	 Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth,
	 And blew blasts two or three;
	 When four and twenty bowmen bold
     Came leaping over the lee.

	 And when they came into the church-yard,
	 Marching all on a row,
	 The first man was Allin a Dale,
     To give bold Robin his bow.

	 This is thy true-love, Robin he said,
	 Young Allin, as I hear say;
	 And you shall be married at this same time,
	 Before we depart away.

	"That shall not be," the bishop he said,
	 "For thy word shall not stand;
	 They shall be three times asked in the church,
	 As the law is of our land."

	 Robin Hood pull'd off the bishop's coat,
	 And put it upon Little John;
	 "By the faith of my body," then Robin said,
	 "This cloath doth make thee a man."

     When Little John went into the quire,
	 The people began for to laugh;
	 He asked them seven times in the church,
	 Least three times should not be enough.

	 "Who gives me this maid?" said Little John;
	 Quoth Robin, "That do I!
	 And he that doth take her from Allin a Dale
	 Full dearly he shall her buy."

	 And thus having ended this merry wedding,
	 The bride lookt as fresh as a queen,
	 And so they return'd to the merry green wood,
	 Amongst the leaves so green.
